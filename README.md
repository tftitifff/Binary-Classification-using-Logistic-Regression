# Binary-Classification-using-Logistic-Regression

Objectives: 
Develop and evaluate a logistic regression classifier to predict binary outcomes. The project focuses on implementing and assessing the model's effectiveness using practical datasets.

Achieve accurate binary classification by training the model with TrainData.csv and TestData.csv, aiming to distinguish between two classes and evaluate the model's predictive performance.
